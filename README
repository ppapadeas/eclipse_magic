**NOTE** At the current time, the "camera.burst()" functionality requires the "lua_fix"
beta build of Magic Lantern which can be found at https://builds.magiclantern.fm/experiments.html.
Hopefully this function will be merged into the mainline soon.

Read through the comments at the top of the script, and modify the contact points to suit
your location, and the exposure settings to suit your camera.  Copy the script to
the ML/SCRIPTS directory on your camera's media, and run it from the menu.

If you have issues, (and you aren't running with the test flag set) you should be able to
reboot your camera, and it will pick up where it left off.  Exposure events are tied to
particular times, not a sequence that needs to start at a specific time.  This is useful if
(for example) you need to change batteries in mid-eclipse.

See http://xjubier.free.fr/en/site_pages/SolarEclipseExposure.html for suggestions for
exposure values.
